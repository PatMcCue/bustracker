# bustracker

This is a map project for my MERN MIT xPro Full Stack Developer course. The goal was to use a real-time API with data about the location of various public transport buses, then show them moving on the map. I was successful in using the API data from Boston but I'm still working on making it work with a Chicago API.

To run this map on your own machine, clone this repo using your terminal:

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/PatMcCue/bustracker/tree/main
2. Click on the green "Code" button, then from the HTTPS menu, copy the url.
3. Go to your Terminal on your local machine. Navigate to whichever directory you would like the bus tracker to be saved in. 
4. Type "git clone" followed by pasting in the URL you got in step 2.
5. Hit enter and you will have created your local clone. Run the files in VS Code.

Licensing
This project is licenced by MIT.

The "Refactoring" Process
I took the original project, a bus tracker in Boston, and moved the map to Chicago to track buses there. I also changed the style of the map by using the Google Maps API. I had to recenter the map, and I changed the color of the waters to kelly green, a little reference to Chicago dyeing the Chicago River green during St. Patrick's Day. I also changed a few more layers within the map styles.

Roadmap for Future Improvement
To improve this project, I'll continue to work with various APIs from other cities, and try using different forms of transportation (subway tracker, ferry tracker, etc.)
